# Quantum dot data acquisation software
### Developped based on the scanning SUQID software used by Moler group, Stanford

This package contains real-time functions to make electrical transport meausrements of a quantum dot, including functions that 

Acquire the current gate voltage from a DAQ output or Keithley

Set gate voltage of a DAQ output or Keithley and ramp at a given speed

Measure temperature dependent resistance 

Meausre resistance when sweeping a gate

Measure resistance map as a function of two gates
